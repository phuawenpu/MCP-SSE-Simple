ðŸ‘¤ You: What is the weather in Africa
ðŸ¤– Claude: I notice you're asking about the weather in Africa, but Africa is actually a continent that contains 54 different countries with vastly different climate zones - from the Sahara Desert in the north to tropical rainforests in the center to more temperate regions in the south. 

To give you accurate weather information, I'll need you to specify a particular city or at least a specific country in Africa. For example, you could ask about:
- Cairo, Egypt
- Nairobi, Kenya
- Cape Town, South Africa
- Lagos, Nigeria

Which specific location in Africa would you like to know the weather for?

Lagos typically experiences two rainy seasons (April to July and October to November) and two dry seasons (December to March and August to September).
